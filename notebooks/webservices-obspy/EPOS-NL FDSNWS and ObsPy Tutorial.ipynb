    "EIDA webservices are designed to provide programmatic access to waveform data and instrument metadata from EIDA. Because webservices requests are URLs, it is possible to communicate directly with the webservice APIs in a browser, command-line tools (e.g. curl; wget) or through abstracted clients (e.g. [ObsPy](http://obspy.org), [fdsnws-fetch](https://github.com/andres-h/fdsnws_scripts/blob/master/fdsnws_fetch.py)).\n",
    "\n",
    "Webservices are identified by the service domain (URL) that is data center specific, a label that identifies the service (e.g. dataselect; station) and a list of request options (e.g. stream identifiers or time window) included in its query string. In this initial exercise we will introduce three webservices:\n",
